#Tourism-at=ease
The program collects information about tourist places from the user and sorts the data based on three criteria. Here's a brief summary of the features of the output:

Input Data: The program asks the user to input data for five tourist places, including:

Name of the place
Number of visitors per day
Entry fees for the place
Average age group of visitors (represented as a single integer, e.g., 25 for the 20-30 age range)
Sorting and Displaying Data:

Sorted by Visitors per Day (Famous Places): The program sorts the places based on the number of visitors per day in descending order, displaying the most popular places first.
Sorted by Fees (Expensive Places): It sorts the places by entry fees in descending order, displaying the most expensive places first.
Sorted by Age Group (Age Preference): It sorts the places based on the average age group in ascending order, displaying places with younger visitors first.
Formatted Display: The program prints the sorted tourist places in a neatly formatted table with columns for the place name, number of visitors per day, entry fees, and average age group.

The output allows the user to compare tourist places based on popularity, cost, and age demographics
